Hey, I'm Ajay
==============

**I'm a student at UC San Diego (class of 2019)** 

I've worked on the open-source [Big Blue Button](http://bigbluebutton.org/) for the [Learn To Be Foundation](http://www.learntobe.org/), and continued as a systems admin for LTB on the side. I've also consulted for [School Loop](http://www.schoolloop.com/) on the UI/UX of their mobile app based on feedback/insight from developing [my own](https://github.com/agopinath/looped). Through high school, I'm glad to have led the [Computer Science club](http://www.mvcompsci.com/) where I would teach students weekly about various CS topics.

I had participated in [Synopsys Science fair](http://science-fair.org/), and worked as a research intern for nearly four years. I was a bioinformatics intern at UCLA's [Rowat Lab](https://www.ibp.ucla.edu/research/rowat/RowatLab.html) using computer vision/image processing on videos of microfluidic devices. I also worked in the [Wall Lab](http://wall-lab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, applying computational/mathematical methods to identify auditory biomarkers of autism in toddlers.

I dance as part of my school's Bollywood dance team, and work out in my free time. Reach me at [ajay.gopinath@outlook.com](mailto:ajay.gopinath@outlook.com). Find my resume [here]({{site.url}}/assets/Resume_AjayGopinath.pdf).
