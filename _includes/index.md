Hey, I'm Ajay
==============
A student at Monta Vista High School in Cupertino, I'm stoked to have worked on what I've worked on, and to be working on what I'm working on. My interests and pursuits are divided broadly into software/programming and academic research. 

I've contributed to the open-source web-conferencing system [Big Blue Button](http://bigbluebutton.org/) as part of the [Learn To Be Foundation](http://www.learntobe.org/), and I've continued as a systems admin for LTB on the side. I've also consulted for [School Loop](http://www.schoolloop.com/) on the UI/UX of their own mobile app based on feedback received for [my own](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyanojay.looped). I adore leading the [Java club](http://www.mvjavaclub.com/) at my school where I lecture students weekly on various, fascinating topics in computer science and their application (club name is legacy and a misnomer! Will be rebranded soon).

I've also worked as a bioinformatics intern as part of UCLA's [Rowat Lab](https://www.ibp.ucla.edu/research/rowat/People.htm) to bridge the gap between high-throughput microfluidic flow devices and their software dependents. Having competed and placed twice in the Synopsys Science Championship, I've continued scientific research on the side extensively for the past three years. I'm currently a member of the [Wall Lab](http://wall-lab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University where I'm working to integrate my skills in programming/CS to build a classifier to distinguish videos of children with autism from those of children without.

As a competitive swimmer and avid athlete, I'm only a part-time nerd. Or try to be.
