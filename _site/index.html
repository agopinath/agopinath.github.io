<h1>
	Hey, I'm Ajay.
</h1>
<p>
	I'm a student at Monta Vista High School in Cupertino and I'm stoked to have worked on the things I have, and to be working on the things I'm working on. I'd divide my interests and pursuits broadly into software/programming, and academic research. As part of the former, I've contributed to the open-source web-conferencing system <a href="http://bigbluebutton.org/">Big Blue Button</a> as part of the Learn To Be Foundation, and I've continued as a systems administrator for Learn To Be on the side. I've also consulted for School Loop on the UI/UX of their own mobile app based on feedback I've received for mine. I continue to enjoy leading the Computer Science club at my school where I lecture to students weekly on various subjects in computer science and engineering.
</br></br>
	As for academic research, I've worked as a bioinformatics intern as part of the Rowat Lab in UCLA, competed and placed twice in the Synopsys Science Championship, and continued scientific research on the side extensively for the past three years. I'm currently a member of the Wall Lab at Stanford where I work on applying my skills in programming - specifically in machine learning - to build a classifier to distinguish videos of children with autism from those of children without.
</br></br>
	A competitive swimmer and avid athlete, I'm only a part-time nerd. Or try to be.
