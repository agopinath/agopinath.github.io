**I'm a developer, dancer and a student at UC San Diego.** 

I've worked on the open-source [Big Blue Button](http://bigbluebutton.org/) for the [Learn To Be Foundation](http://www.learntobe.org/), and continued as a systems admin for LTB on the side. I've also consulted for [School Loop](http://www.schoolloop.com/) on the UI/UX of their mobile app based on feedback/insight from developing [my own](https://github.com/agopinath/looped). Through high school, I'm glad to have led the [Computer Science club](http://www.mvcompsci.com/) where I would teach students weekly about various CS topics. 

I dance as part of my school's Bollywood dance team, and work out in my free time. Reach me at [ajay.gopinath@outlook.com](mailto:ajay.gopinath@outlook.com)
