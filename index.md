**I'm a student developer and researcher, stoked to have done what I've done, and to be doing what I'm doing.** 

I've worked on the open-source [Big Blue Button](http://bigbluebutton.org/) for the [Learn To Be Foundation](http://www.learntobe.org/), and continued as a systems admin for LTB on the side. I've also consulted for [School Loop](http://www.schoolloop.com/) on the UI/UX of their mobile app based on feedback/insight from developing [my own](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyanojay.looped). I'm excited to lead the [Computer Science club](http://www.mvcompsci.com/) at my school where I lecture students weekly on various CS topics. 

Having participated  twice at the [Synopsys Science fair](http://science-fair.org/), I've continued scientific research for the past three years. I was a bioinformatics intern at UCLA's [Rowat Lab](https://www.ibp.ucla.edu/research/rowat/RowatLab.html) to bridge the gap between high-throughput microfluidic devices and their software dependents. I also worked in the [Wall Lab](http://wall-lab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, applying computational/mathematical methods to identify auditory biomarkers of autism in toddlers.

As a competitive swimmer and avid athlete, I'm only a part-time nerd. Or try to be.

I'm based in Cupertino, CA. Reach me at [ajay.gopinath@outlook.com](mailto:ajay.gopinath@outlook.com)
