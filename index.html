<h1 id="hey-im-ajay">Hey, I&#8217;m Ajay.</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m a student at Monta Vista High School in Cupertino, stoked to have worked on what I&#8217;ve worked on, and to be working on what I&#8217;m working on. My interests and pursuits are roughly divided into software/programming and academic research. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve contributed to the open-source <a href="http://bigbluebutton.org/">Big Blue Button</a> to deliver a web-conferencing system to the <a href="http://www.learntobe.org/">Learn To Be Foundation</a>, and have continued as a systems admin for LTB on the side. I&#8217;ve also consulted for <a href="http://www.schoolloop.com/">School Loop</a> on the UI/UX of their mobile app based on feedback/insight from developing <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyanojay.looped">my own</a>. I adore leading the <a href="http://www.mvjavaclub.com/">Java club</a> at my school where I lecture students weekly on various topics in computer science.</p>

<p>Having placed twice at the <a href="http://science-fair.org/">Synopsys Science Championship</a>, I&#8217;ve continued scientific research extensively for the past three years. I&#8217;ve interned as a bioinformatician in UCLA&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ibp.ucla.edu/research/rowat/RowatLab.html">Rowat Lab</a> to bridge the gap between high-throughput microfluidic flow devices and their software dependents. I&#8217;m currently a member of the <a href="http://wall-lab.stanford.edu/">Wall Lab</a> at Stanford University where I&#8217;m applying computer vision/machine learning to build a classifier to distinguish videos of children with autism from those of children without.</p>

<p>As a competitive swimmer and avid athlete, I&#8217;m only a part-time nerd. Or try to be.</p>
