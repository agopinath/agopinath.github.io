<p><strong>I&#8217;m a student developer and researcher, attending Monta Vista High School in Cupertino, stoked to have worked on what I&#8217;ve worked on, and to be working on what I&#8217;m working on.</strong> </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve worked on the open-source <a href="http://bigbluebutton.org/">Big Blue Button</a> to deliver a web-conferencing system to the <a href="http://www.learntobe.org/">Learn To Be Foundation</a>, and continued as a systems admin for LTB on the side. I&#8217;ve also consulted for <a href="http://www.schoolloop.com/">School Loop</a> on the UI/UX of their mobile app based on feedback/insight from developing <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyanojay.looped">my own</a>. I adore leading the <a href="http://www.mvcompsci.com/">Computer Science club</a> at my school where I lecture students weekly on various computer science topics. </p>

<p>Some of my current areas of research/interest in CS are classification techniques leveraging AI/machine learning, like <a href="http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_naive_bayes_1.html">NBCs</a>, data compression solutions (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch">LZW</a>), and <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/">pathfinding</a>.</p>

<p>Having placed twice at the <a href="http://science-fair.org/">Synopsys Science Championship</a>, I&#8217;ve continued scientific research extensively for the past three years. I&#8217;ve interned as a bioinformatician in UCLA&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ibp.ucla.edu/research/rowat/RowatLab.html">Rowat Lab</a> to bridge the gap between high-throughput microfluidic devices and their software dependents. I&#8217;m currently a member of the <a href="http://wall-lab.stanford.edu/">Wall Lab</a> at Stanford University, applying computer vision/machine learning to build a classifier to distinguish videos of children with autism from those of children without.</p>

<p>As a competitive swimmer and avid athlete, I&#8217;m only a part-time nerd. Or try to be.</p>
