<h1 id="hey-im-ajay">Hey, I&#8217;m Ajay</h1>
<p>A student at Monta Vista High School in Cupertino, I&#8217;m stoked to have worked on what I&#8217;ve worked on, and to be working on what I&#8217;m working on. My interests and pursuits are divided broadly into software/programming and academic research. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve contributed to the open-source web-conferencing system <a href="http://bigbluebutton.org/">Big Blue Button</a> as part of the <a href="http://www.learntobe.org/">Learn To Be Foundation</a>, and I&#8217;ve continued as a systems admin for LTB on the side. I&#8217;ve also consulted for <a href="http://www.schoolloop.com/">School Loop</a> on the UI/UX of their own mobile app based on feedback received for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyanojay.looped">my own</a>. I adore leading the <a href="http://www.mvjavaclub.com/">Java club</a> at my school where I lecture students weekly on various, fascinating topics in computer science and their application (club name is legacy and a misnomer! Will be rebranded soon).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also worked as a bioinformatics intern as part of UCLA&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ibp.ucla.edu/research/rowat/People.htm">Rowat Lab</a> to bridge the gap between high-throughput microfluidic flow devices and their software dependents. Having competed and placed twice in the Synopsys Science Championship, I&#8217;ve continued scientific research on the side extensively for the past three years. I&#8217;m currently a member of the <a href="http://wall-lab.stanford.edu/">Wall Lab</a> at Stanford University where I&#8217;m working to integrate my skills in programming/CS to build a classifier to distinguish videos of children with autism from those of children without.</p>

<p>As a competitive swimmer and avid athlete, I&#8217;m only a part-time nerd. Or try to be.</p>
