I'm a student developer and researcher, attending Monta Vista High School in Cupertino, stoked to have worked on what I've worked on, and to be working on what I'm working on. 

I've contributed to the open-source [Big Blue Button](http://bigbluebutton.org/) to deliver a web-conferencing system to the [Learn To Be Foundation](http://www.learntobe.org/), and have continued as a systems admin for LTB on the side. I've also consulted for [School Loop](http://www.schoolloop.com/) on the UI/UX of their mobile app based on feedback/insight from developing [my own](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyanojay.looped). I adore leading the [Java club](http://www.mvjavaclub.com/) at my school where I lecture students weekly on various topics in computer science.

Having placed twice at the [Synopsys Science Championship](http://science-fair.org/), I've continued scientific research extensively for the past three years. I've interned as a bioinformatician in UCLA's [Rowat Lab](https://www.ibp.ucla.edu/research/rowat/RowatLab.html) to bridge the gap between high-throughput microfluidic devices and their software dependents. I'm currently a member of the [Wall Lab](http://wall-lab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, applying computer vision/machine learning to build a classifier to distinguish videos of children with autism from those of children without.

As a competitive swimmer and avid athlete, I'm only a part-time nerd. Or try to be.
