Hey, I'm Ajay.
==============
I'm a student at Monta Vista High School in Cupertino, stoked to have worked on what I've worked on, and to be working on what I'm working on. My interests and pursuits are roughly divided into software/ programming and academic research. 

I've contributed to the open-source [Big Blue Button](http://bigbluebutton.org/) to deliver a web-conferencing system to the [Learn To Be Foundation](http://www.learntobe.org/), and have continued as a systems admin for LTB on the side. I've also consulted for [School Loop](http://www.schoolloop.com/) on the UI/UX of their mobile app based on feedback/insight from developing [my own](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyanojay.looped). I adore leading the [Java club](http://www.mvjavaclub.com/) at my school where I lecture students weekly on various, fascinating topics in computer science (club name is legacy and a misnomer! Will be rebranded soon).

I've also interned as a bioinformatician as part of UCLA's [Rowat Lab](https://www.ibp.ucla.edu/research/rowat/RowatLab.html) to bridge the gap between high-throughput microfluidic flow devices and their software dependents. Having competed and placed twice in the Synopsys Science Championship, I've continued scientific research extensively for the past three years. I'm currently a member of the [Wall Lab](http://wall-lab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University where I'm applying computer vision/machine learning to build a classifier to distinguish videos of children with autism from those of children without.

As a competitive swimmer and avid athlete, I'm only a part-time nerd. Or try to be.
