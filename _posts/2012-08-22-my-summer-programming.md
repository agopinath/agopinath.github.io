_This reflection was written shortly after completing the project in the summer of my freshman year of high school. Any apparent angst has since been replaced by gratitutde for having this opportunity to do something fruitful and impactful during the summer! Here it is, unedited. And thank you, LTB!_

This summer I worked on web-conferencing system for a non-profit organization called The Learn To Be Foundation that helps tutor unprivileged students across the U.S. across the Internet. My project started out with everyone&#39;s hopes high, including mine, and my optimistic outlook on how awesome this project was going to be. My naive self had no idea how much commitment and grueling hours of work would be put into what at first seemed nothing more than something to pass time during the summer. If only I could go back in time and tell myself I was in for a surprise, I might&#39;ve been more prepared. 

I&#39;m not gonna lie, I had a blast working on the project, got to know some really cool people, and prided myself on doing very selfless work indeed. Unfortunately, altruism just doesn&#39;t cut it sometimes. I soon found myself questioning the very purpose of my efforts. I wasn&#39;t getting paid, was wasting away the few days of solace summer offers, and was working overtime (10+ hours a day) to deliver a project I wasn&#39;t even sure would ever get deployed. The days degraded into a vicious cycle of working late into the night only to take breaks to compensate for the toll on my mind and body which spurred further late night shifts. At one point I even wanted summer to end just so that I could get away from doing the project. Needless to say, I was miserable for a good part of the time I worked on it, but enjoyed the few brief &quot;Aha&quot; moments that embellish most software development projects. Cue what-did-I-do-to-deserve-this sob story.

I ended up finishing up all of the previously discussed goals for the project, and wrapped it up with a final meeting that included some of the LTB organization members. After receiving extensive compliments and thanks from the attendees, I felt slightly better. However, it wasn&#39;t until the two or three days after the project&#39;s end when I had a chance to wind-down with a rejuvenating visit to several beaches that I realized the true reaches to which my work extends. Before that time, I was unsatisfied with my summer, and moreover, myself. I had feared that everything I had worked on up until that point was below-expectations, a waste of time, and above all, insignificant. Since that time, I&#39;ve come to realize that such fears are unfounded, and that there&#39;s always a reason to continue. This project has been a real eye-opener for me and has left me with more good things to take away from it than bad. I hope that in the future, I get to work on other cool projects, but with my new-found experience guiding me. 

The project spanned from start-to-finish a total of 9 weeks, and really educated me on a couple different skills to have for software development in general that can be broadened to life lessons and applied to other areas as well. As a post-mortem of the experience, the following is a traversal into the details of these lessons.

**You can never plan enough**

As with any project, planning is crucial. In my project, I was in recurring situations where I found myself having to plan and write code at the same time. Not a very good idea. I would start planning only to realize I&#39;d lost my momentum and I would have to focus again on what I was trying to do in the first place. Despite a very thorough and comprehensive plan beforehand of my goals for the project, things change (something I found out the hard way) and I realized that the entire section on how I was going to do the recording of user-sessions for my project was rendered obsolete when I realized I had misinterpreted how recording in BigBlueButton (the open-source software I was using as a framework) functions. Needless to say, I was thrown off and it caused me to change around everything in my development schedule. This could have been avoided if I had done more research into how the recording works then, instead of finding out at development-time that I had messed up.

**Make sure project goals are clearly defined**

You never want to be stuck in that awkward situation where you and your client have ambiguity over what will be accomplished for that project. For this reason, it is essential to have project goals defined beforehand so that any such ambiguity is cleared up immediately. For this reason, I was fortunate enough to have negotiated the possible goals for my project before starting and had outlined them in a Google Doc, eliminating concerns over my goals.

**Adhere to deadlines as best as you can**

Never putting off work that can be done now for later is something that many try to, but sometimes fail to do. From my personal experience, this is the absolute best thing to do that will ensure your sanity during a project, and helps you to avoid creeping over deadlines only to realize you don&#39;t have enough time to finish the next goal. If for some 
reason, a deadline cannot be reached, re-evaluate your goals and re-prioritize them in order to make sure you can at least get a MVP out.

**Be in-sync with your clients**

You don&#39;t want to take heat from your clients for not being able to finish a goal in time. Make sure that you communicate your progress in the project as often as you can. Keep in mind that your client would rather have you give him too much information about the state of the project than too little.

**Get into the &quot;inner circle&quot; of open source projects, if you&#39;re working on one**

One thing that always helps when you&#39;re working on an open-source project, is to make sure you&#39;re active in the project community, in good standing, and in-touch with the heads of the project who can give you information about the project. In my situation, BigBlueButton was a project in very active development, which I was able to leverage and have a good part of the code I needed to write done for me in parallel to my project by some of their developers. This allowed me to figure out how to better other aspects of the project and take some weight off my back. A word of caution: don&#39;t base your development schedule on these developers&#39; proposed release times, as they are very tentative and can wreak havoc with your own schedule. Do your work as if they weren&#39;t working on it, but avoid duplication of code and try to figure out other parts of the project first.

**If you feel like you&#39;re in a rut, it&#39;s time for a break**

I frequently found myself in situations where I&#39;ve been working for hours on end, and deadlines were coming up fast but I&#39;ve barely done anything to meet them. More often than not, these were alleviated with a break for an hour or two for most people. I found that watching TV or just getting away from the computer for a while and going outside would clear my mind so that I could rationally figure out the next plan of action. While the amount of break may vary from person-to-person as well as the activity, breaks from time-to-time are intrinsically good ways to improve productivity.
