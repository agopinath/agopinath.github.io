The summer of my sophomore year was filled with a lot of work. Quite some fun, but a lot of work, too. I worked from home with the Rowat Lab, an integrative biology lab at UCLA, to write code to do image analysis/video processing of videos of cancer cells moving through microscopic constrictions in what are known as microfluidic devices. Cancer cells (specificically, APL cells, a kind of cancerous WBCs) have been shown to exhibit markedly different mechanical characteristics than do noncancerous cells. The goal of the research was to answer &quot;what happens to cancer cells when we squeeze them, and why?&quot;[^1]

While I worked remotely over the summer, I made two trips to L.A. during the time in which I visited the lab. There, I worked with grad students and the lab&#39;s PI, Dr. Rowat, to brainstorm and plan the code, as well as the paper I&#39;m writing on new data gleaned with the code - to be submitted for publication.

But more striking than the workings of the code is what I&#39;ve gleaned from my interactions with Dr. Rowat and her grad students, and what I&#39;ve learned about academia/scientific research as a whole, and what it means to me. I&#39;d done science fairs before, but that summer altered my perception of what it means to do professional scientific research.

Scientists aren&#39;t robots
--------------------------
Though it seems very naive in retrospect, I had imagined scientists/professors/academics to be disconnected, intellectual robots churning out seminal papers and world-changing discoveries like it was part of their routine. In my mind, they very much fit the traditional &quot;mad scientist&quot; stereotype - old, with frizzy graying hair, poring over notes and findings late into the night, only to be struck by a shard of genius at 3 AM, yelling &quot;Eureka!&quot;[^2]

What I didn&#39;t consider is how human they really are. That they need and vacations to travel and unwind. That they take sick days off work, stuck home with the flu trying their best to respond to emails. That they laugh and joke sometimes too. Did you know beer is as common a topic in academic settings as it is in workplaces?

For instance, back in August 2013...

&quot;Is it too early to think of a tentative deadline for the paper?&quot;

&quot;I think wrapping things up this fall could be a reasonable target.&quot; Dr. Rowat looked at Kendra and Mike - the grad students - for their nods of approval.

_Hmm...yeah that could work. School wouldn&#39;t be too busy at the start so I could put in more time for this. Oh man, this is so cool. I&#39;m gonna work so hard on this. So pumped up, can&#39;t believe this is actually happening--_

&quot;Oh! Would you like some chocolates? Just got back from a trip to __________.&quot;[^3] She picked up off the ground a small, semi-full box -- the kind used to hold artificial sweeteners.

&quot;Hmmm?&quot; I stared. &quot;Oh, uh yeah, sure!&quot; I said, maybe with a little too much enthusiasm, as she poured some chocolates into a Target bag. _Awkward. Should I have refused? Am I weird for accepting the PI&#39;s chocolates?_ The grad students just smiled. _Weren&#39;t we here to talk intense science-y talk? Well, we did, but still. What&#39;s with the chocolates?_

I look back on this not as an unexpected, out-of-place series of events but rather a very endearing, natural exchange. A good thing too. If scientists/academics/researchers aren&#39;t so different than you and I, maybe I can be one too, someday.

Slowly, the intimidating facade put up by academic jargon and esoteric ideas in a scientific publication falls over to reveal a person much like the rest of us, who went to high school, maybe dabbled around in science then, and worked their way up from the fundamentals to the complex, pushing at the limits of human knowledge to make their dent.

Data quality trumps quantity
------------------------------
Many times when I analyzed the results of the code and they were not what I expected, I would go back and reprocess the data because I thought the differences in my expectations and the reality were caused by minor factors which I had overlooked in the code at first which I didn&#39;t think would affect the results. These were almost negligible things like having a logical mask (used to mask the binary image of detected cells) be offset by a pixel or two.

Invariably my results from reprocessing would not be significantly affected by correcting for these minor errors, but I had wasted time to reprocess tens of videos. And regardless of how many videos and data to process I had, if the error did affect the results in any way, I couldn&#39;t in good faith believe any of it. The consequence of such errors (namely, wasted time) only scaled with the amount of data I had.

I look back at these incidents as blatantly erring on the side of confirmation bias, for had I seen the results I expected the first time around, I wouldn&#39;t have doubted the quality of the results and tried to correct for these minor issues. It&#39;s so much easier to make sure each step of the analytical process is foolproof and run through the cycle once, than to hurry through and then re-iterate. It&#39;s also much better science.

Science as an inductive process
--------------------------------
One ideological aspect I wish I had realized sooner is how much science should be based on drawing conclusions from data, rather than trying to fit the data to some vague notions of what the data &quot;should&quot; signify. Especially after delving thoroughly into much of the literature behind other non-microfluidic techniques used for probing cells, I soon began to see what we could draw from our data as others had done in these papers. 

I failed to fully understand the difference in methods used, and why, for example, the cell&#39;s elastic modulus (when the cell is modeled as a Newtonian liquid drop) could be derived from micropipette aspiration experiments, but not from our microfluidic methods. The actual reason(s) why we couldn&#39;t didn&#39;t matter much, but because I was looking at what others had done and trying to force the metaphorical square peg into a round hole, I spent more time than I should have focusing on the works of others than my own.

This isn&#39;t to advocate withdrawl from the works of others, or anything even close to that, but to caution that your own data should be taken into careful consideration first before trying to apply the works of others to the data.

Take a step back
-----------------
I&#39;m tend to follow problems down the rabbit hole, and while working on complex problems, it&#39;s easy to lose perspective. Sometimes I would get so focused in resolving minor issues that I would lose the bigger picture of what exactly I was trying to do, if any alternatives sufficed, and whether the issue was even important enough to warrant my time. 

I found keeping a notebook helped, and especially just the act of getting my ideas down on paper made them so much more organized. Things like making a pros and cons list, or even taking a step back to look at my notes opened up new directions and helped me keep on task.

Qualities of a great scientist
------------------------------
Writing this reflection almost a year after directly talking with Dr. Rowat, I outline below some of the more salient qualities I think distinguish great researchers. I also base the following in part on my interactions with the Wall Lab&#39;s PI, Dr. Wall, with whom I currently work (at the time of this writing). I use the term academic loosely to mean someone who does scientific research as a profession, but more specifically, the head researcher of a lab.

**Responsiveness**

Email responses within the hour are the norm, and replies within the minute aren&#39;t unheard of. In these labs, among the best in the world in what they do, the pace of the scientific process and discoveries are everything, and if you can get the information you need _that_ much more quickly and _when_ you actually need it, the better. Aside from that, sheer professionalism plays a part as well.

Besides that, a great academic is adept at communicating research as much as doing the research, which necessitates great salesmanship of a kind: being able to highlight the importance of the research without overselling its consequence.[^4]

**Inquisitiveness**

My some-th grade English teacher once told our class that &quot;interesting&quot; is the least interesting and most boring word in the English language. That we shoud never use it. 

But in the world of scientific research, &quot;interesting&quot; carries more nuanced connotations than the mere filler word it&#39;s often made out to be. Science works through numbers, and when your PI tells you that a certain direction would be &quot;interesting&quot; to look into, it&#39;s a hint that the surface of that direction might belie a quantitatve goldmine.

A good academic can find something &quot;interesting&quot; in the seemingly uninteresting. An even better academic can intuitively hone in on the signal, the truly &quot;interesting, through the noise. But what&#39;s common to any great academic is an intrinsic drive to explore data and make meaning of numbers.

...more to come.
